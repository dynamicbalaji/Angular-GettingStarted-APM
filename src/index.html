  index.html contains the main page for the application
  This is often the only web page of the application
  Hence an Angular application is often called a Single Page Application (SPA)

    First step to setup routing is to define a base element in the head tag of index.html. Notice that
      Angular CLI already did that for us (<base href="/">) This element tells the router how to compose
      the navigation URLs. Since the app folder is the app root, we'll set the href for the base tag
      to slash

    pm-root is the selector name given in app.component.ts
    In HTML, its called as directive
    Directive - Custom HTML element or attribute used to power up and extend our HTML
      Custom or Built In Directives

        *ngIf - If logic
        *ngFor - For loops
          Notice the * infront of the directive name, that marks the directive as a structural directive
